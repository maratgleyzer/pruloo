section located at the top of the pages of the ezprofitclub.com website;

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Free Trials</b> <br>
We encourage the use of our service through free trials. To view the 
specific details regarding your free trial, if any, click on the &quot;Settings&quot; 
link located at the top of the ezprofitclub.com website page; you must 
be &quot;logged in&quot; to view this section. <br>
 <br>

Free trials are only available to first time customers of the ezprofitclub.com 
service and cannot be combined with any other free trial offer. Only 
one free trial may be redeemed by a retailer or retailer&#39;s organization 
and its agents. You must have Internet access and a valid form of currently-accepted 
payment such as a credit card, debit card, or alternative valid form 
of currently accepted payment (&quot;Payment Method&quot;) to redeem 
a free trial offer. Upon registering for your free trial, your Payment 
Method may be authorized up to the term of service for which you joined. 
In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may reflect 
the authorization; however, no charges will be made against the Payment 
Method unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your free trial 
period. The day you start your trial is considered &#39;Day 1&#39; of the trial, 
regardless of the time of day you register. <br>
 <br>
We will begin billing your Payment Method for subscription fees corresponding 
to your subscription program on a monthly basis plus any applicable 
tax at the end of your free trial period unless you cancel prior to 
the end of your free trial. You may not receive a notice from us that 
your free trial has ended or that your paying subscription has begun. 
YOU MUST CANCEL PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL OFFER TO AVOID CHARGES 
TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. For subscriptions, we will continue to bill 
your Payment Method on a monthly basis for your subscription program 
until you cancel. You may cancel your subscription at anytime. We offer 
a number of subscription programs, including special promotional programs 
with differing pricing, length of subscription terms, and bundles. Some 
of these promotions are offered by third parties in conjunction with 
the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible 
for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve 
the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription 
programs. <br>
 <br>
If you are contacted by a sales agent within your free trial and agree 
to a charge for a promotional membership, your free trial is void the 
moment you accept the charge.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Billing</b> <br>

By using the ezprofitclub.com service, you are expressly agreeing that 
we are permitted to bill you a recurring monthly subscription fee, any 
applicable tax and any other charges you may incur in connection with 
your use of the ezprofitclub.com service. As used in these Terms of 
Use, &quot;billing&quot; shall indicate either a charge or debit, as 
applicable, against your Payment Method. The subscription fee will be 
billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each monthly renewal 
thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. Click on the 
&quot;Billing&quot; link on the &quot;Settings&quot; page to see the 
commencement date for your next renewal period. We will automatically 
bill or attempt to bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar 
day corresponding to the commencement of your membership. In the event 
your membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we will 
bill or attempt to bill your Payment Method on the last day of such 
month. For example, if you became a paying member on January 31st, your 
Payment Method would next be billed or attempted to be billed on February 
28th. All fees and charges are nonrefundable. We may change the fees 
and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, 
but we will give you advance notice of these changes by e mail or to 
your account upon login. If you want to use a different Payment Method 
or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, 
you may edit your Payment Method information by clicking on the &quot;My 
Account&quot; button, available at the top of the pages of the ezprofitclub.com 
website. If your Payment Method reaches its expiration date, your continued 
access of the service constitutes your authorization for us to continue 
billing that Payment Method. If ezprofitclub.com attempts to bill your 
Payment Method and does so unsuccessfully, you grant ezprofitclub.com 
the right to attempt to process and bill your Payment Method for up 
to 180 days as well as bill your Payment Method for any unsuccessful 
accruing billings during such time.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Automatic Renewals</b> <br>

Your ezprofitclub.com subscription will be automatically renewed on 
a monthly basis. For your convenience, we will bill the monthly fee 
plus any applicable tax to the Payment Method you provide to us during 
registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account 
information). Your membership will automatically renew for successive 
monthly subscriptions, without prior notice to you, unless and until 
you cancel your membership or we terminate it. You must cancel your 
membership before it renews each month order to avoid billing of the 
next month&#39;s subscription fees to your Payment Method. You are not eligible 
to receive refunds once your Payment Method has been billed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Cancellation</b> <br>
