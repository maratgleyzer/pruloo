Information Automatically Collected</b>   <br>

We automatically receive and collect certain types of information whenever 
you visit our Web site. For example, like many Web sites, we use &quot;cookies&quot; 
and Web beacons (described below) and obtain certain types of information 
when your Web browser accesses our Web sites. This information includes 
the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer, your browser software 
and operating system, your web server, the date and time you access 
our site, session information (such as download errors and page response 
times), information about your viewing, search and purchase history 
and information about the referring URL and the URL clickstream to, 
through, and from our Web sites. We use this information to monitor 
the usage and performance of our Web site, to enhance our customers&#39; 
search and shopping experiences and to determine aggregate information 
about our user base and usage patterns.   <br>
 <b> <br>
Information From Third Parties</b>   <br>
If we receive updated account information from third parties, we may 
revise your account for you so that we can efficiently process your 
orders, deliver your products or otherwise communicate with you. For 
example, we may receive customer information from our shippers or from 
third parties with which we operate co-branded businesses. In addition, 
we may acquire customer names, e-mail addresses and mailing addresses 
for select mailings from third parties.   <br>
 <b> <br>

provide product reviews, or provide alternative delivery addresses. 
  <br>
 <b> <br>
Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</b>   <br>
We protect all of your information against unauthorized access or release. 
We share your personal and shipping information with third parties as 
follows: </font></p>

<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">No personal information 
  will be shared with any third parties without the customer’s permission</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>No Collection of Information 
from Children</b>   <br>
Our Web site is not intended for users under the age of 18, and we do 
not knowingly collect or retain information in connection with the web 
site from children under the age of 18.   <br>
 <b> <br>
Security</b>   <br>

When you place an order online with us, your personal information and 
credit card or debit card information are encrypted using SSL encryption 
technology before being sent over the Internet. We use SSL technology 
to prevent your information from being stolen or intercepted during 
any transfer to us. Your credit card information is always stored in 
encrypted form in a restricted-access database that is away from our 
Web site database so it is not connected to the Internet, to keep it 
safe from hackers.   <br>
 <b> <br>
Cookies</b>   <br>
To personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience, we 
use a feature on your Internet browser called a cookie. Cookies are 
small files that your Web browser places on your computer&#39;s hard drive. 
We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer and to retrieve 
certain information previously provided by you to us, so that you do 
not need to re-enter this information every time you shop at the site. 
Cookies also let us know how you found us (e.g., through a particular 
web site or advertisement). Cookies are not used to access information 
entered on the secure server. This information can be accessed only 
when you enter your name and password. If you choose to configure your 
browser to remove or reject our cookies, you will not be able to make 
purchases from our Web stores or take advantage of many of our features.

Web Beacons</b>   <br>
From time to time we contract with third party companies to help us 
better provide relevant products, services and information to you and 
to help us effectively measure advertising effectiveness. Some of these 
companies use cookies and/or Web beacons (also known as action tags 
or single pixel gifs). A Web beacon is a transparent image that has 
been placed on a Web page and sends a signal when a user has visited 
that page. A Web beacon does not contain any personal information. No 
information that is personally identifiable to you is transmitted to 
the third party using the Web beacon. The third party is required to 
protect the privacy of the information it receives using Web beacons 
or cookies and is not allowed to use the information it receives for 
any purpose beyond what is necessary to assist us. In addition, we may 
use web beacons in connection with the e-mails we send to our customers, 
to determine whether and when the images in our e-mail were rendered 
(which allows us to determine whether the e-mail was opened). This information 
may then be aggregated and used to assess the effectiveness of our e-mail 
communications.   <br>
 <b> <br>
Unsolicited E-mail (SPAM)</b>   <br>
Your privacy is very important to us. Be assured that, in accordance 
with this privacy policy, we do not sell or distribute our customer 
list to third parties except where you have given consent in this privacy 
policy. You should be aware, however, that unscrupulous marketers can 
sometimes &quot;harvest&quot; your e-mail address directly from your 
computer or another person&#39;s address book or even obtain your e-mail 
address through programs that automatically search web pages and e-mail 
traffic for e-mail addresses. Please note that all e-mail that originates 
from us will either display the customer service phone number, logo 
(HTML e-mails only). In addition, our e-mails will contain our corporate 
address and an unsubscribe link.   <br>

 <b> <br>
Linked Web Sites</b>   <br>
Our Web sites may contain links to and from other sites operated and 
maintained by separate companies. We have no responsibility for linked 
Web sites (including the Web sites of participants in our associate 
program) and provide these links solely for the convenience and information 
of our visitors. The privacy policies of these sites may differ from 
our policy, so you should always review the privacy statement of each 
linked Web site you visit.   <br>
 <b> <br>
Your Consent</b>   <br>
By using our Web site (including through our customer service line), 
you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of information in 
accordance with the terms of this privacy policy. As stated above, we 
reserve the right to modify or amend this policy at any time. Unless 
we clearly state otherwise, the changes to our privacy policy will affect 
only the information we collect after the effective date of the change.
